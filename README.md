# Themecord
Discord theme that will always match your wallpaper!

# Installation
Copy this repo and execute install script

```
git clone https://github.com/danihek/Themecord
cd Themecord
./install
```
# Dependencies
- python-pywal
- swww
- vencord
# Usage / Binding
Installation script created ```~/dotfiles/scripts``` folder to store ```discordColors.sh``` and ```update_wallpaper.sh```

If you are using Wayland you can use ```update_wallpaper.sh``` which uses swww - It should work out of the box, but you can write your own similar script and use ```discordColors.sh``` to copy css to directly to discord .css
I recommend bind it for quick access or write rofi script for better management
